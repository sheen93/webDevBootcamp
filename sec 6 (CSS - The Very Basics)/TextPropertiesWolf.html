    <h1>WOLF</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>
        The wolf (Canis lupus;[b] pl: wolves), also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf, is a large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canis">canine</a> native to
        Eurasia and North America. More than thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized, including the dog
        and dingo, though gray wolves, as popularly understood, only comprise naturally-occurring wild subspecies. The
        wolf is the largest extant member of the family Canidae, and is further distinguished from other Canis species
        by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail. The wolf is nonetheless
        related closely enough to smaller Canis species, such as the coyote and the golden jackal, to produce fertile
        hybrids with them. The wolf's fur is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and black, although subspecies in the
        arctic region may be nearly all white.

        Of all members of the genus Canis, the wolf is most specialized for cooperative game hunting as demonstrated by
        its physical adaptations to tackling large prey, its more social nature, and its highly advanced expressive
        behaviour, including individual or group howling. It travels in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair
        accompanied by their offspring. Offspring may leave to form their own packs on the onset of sexual maturity and
        in response to competition for food within the pack. Wolves are also territorial, and fights over territory are
        among the principal causes of mortality. The wolf is mainly a carnivore and feeds on large wild hooved mammals
        as well as smaller animals, livestock, carrion, and garbage. Single wolves or mated pairs typically have higher
        success rates in hunting than do large packs. Pathogens and parasites, notably the rabies virus, may infect
        wolves.

        The global wild wolf population was estimated to be 300,000 in 2003 and is considered to be of Least Concern by
        the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Wolves have a long history of interactions with
        humans, having been despised and hunted in most pastoral communities because of their attacks on livestock,
        while conversely being respected in some agrarian and hunter-gatherer societies. Although the fear of wolves
        exists in many human societies, the majority of recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals
        suffering from rabies. Wolf attacks on humans are rare because wolves are relatively few, live away from people,
        and have developed a fear of humans because of their experiences with hunters, farmers, ranchers, and shepherds.

    <h2>Etimology</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The English "wolf" stems from the Old English wulf, which is itself thought to be derived from the
        Proto-Germanic *wulfaz. The Proto-Indo-European root *wĺ̥kʷos may also be the source of the Latin word for the
        animal lupus (*lúkʷos).[5][6] The name "gray wolf" refers to the grayish colour of the species.[7]

        Since pre-Christian times, Germanic peoples such as the Anglo-Saxons took on wulf as a prefix or suffix in their
        names. Examples include Wulfhere ("Wolf Army"), Cynewulf ("Royal Wolf"), Cēnwulf ("Bold Wolf"), Wulfheard
        ("Wolf-hard"), Earnwulf ("Eagle Wolf"), Wulfstān ("Wolf Stone") Æðelwulf ("Noble Wolf"), Wolfhroc
        ("Wolf-Frock"), Wolfhetan ("Wolf Hide"), Scrutolf ("Garb Wolf"), Wolfgang ("Wolf Gait") and Wolfdregil ("Wolf
        Runner").[8]

    <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
    <hr>

    <p>
        In 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus published in his Systema Naturae the binomial
        nomenclature.[4] Canis is the Latin word meaning "dog",[10] and under this genus he listed the doglike
        carnivores including domestic dogs, wolves, and jackals. He classified the domestic dog as Canis familiaris, and
        the wolf as Canis lupus.[4] Linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its
        "cauda recurvata" (upturning tail) which is not found in any other canid.[11]

    <h3>Subspecies</h3>
    <p>
        In the third edition of Mammal Species of the World published in 2005, the mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft
        listed under C. lupus 36 wild subspecies, and proposed two additional subspecies: familiaris (Linnaeus, 1758)
        and dingo (Meyer, 1793). Wozencraft included hallstromi—the New Guinea singing dog—as a taxonomic synonym for
        the dingo. Wozencraft referred to a 1999 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) study as one of the guides in forming his
        decision, and listed the 38 subspecies of C. lupus under the biological common name of "wolf", the nominate
        subspecies being the Eurasian wolf (C. l. lupus) based on the type specimen that Linnaeus studied in Sweden.[12]
        Studies using paleogenomic techniques reveal that the modern wolf and the dog are sister taxa, as modern wolves
        are not closely related to the population of wolves that was first domesticated.[13] In 2019, a workshop hosted
        by the IUCN/Species Survival Commission's Canid Specialist Group considered the New Guinea singing dog and the
        dingo to be feral Canis familiaris, and therefore should not be assessed for the IUCN Red List.[14]

    <h3>Evolution</h3>
    <p>
        The phylogenetic descent of the extant wolf C. lupus from C. etruscus through C. mosbachensis is widely
        accepted.[15] The earliest fossils of C. lupus were found in what was once eastern Beringia at Old Crow, Yukon,
        Canada, and at Cripple Creek Sump, Fairbanks, Alaska. The age is not agreed upon but could date to one million
        years ago. Considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves by the Late Pleistocene. They had more
        robust skulls and teeth than modern wolves, often with a shortened snout, a pronounced development of the
        temporalis muscle, and robust premolars. It is proposed that these features were specialized adaptations for the
        processing of carcass and bone associated with the hunting and scavenging of Pleistocene megafauna. Compared
        with modern wolves, some Pleistocene wolves showed an increase in tooth breakage similar to that seen in the
        extinct dire wolf. This suggests they either often processed carcasses, or that they competed with other
        carnivores and needed to consume their prey quickly. Compared with those found in the modern spotted hyena, the
        frequency and location of tooth fractures in these wolves indicates they were habitual bone crackers.[16]

        Genomic studies suggest modern wolves and dogs descend from a common ancestral wolf population[17][18][19] that
        existed 20,000 years ago.[17] A 2021 study found that the Himalayan wolf and the Indian plains wolf are part of
        a lineage that is basal to other wolves and split from them 200,000 years ago.[20] Other wolves appear to have
        originated in Beringia in an expansion that was driven by the huge ecological changes during the close of the
        Late Pleistocene.[21] A study in 2016 indicates that a population bottleneck was followed by a rapid radiation
        from an ancestral population at a time during, or just after, the Last Glacial Maximum. This implies the
        original morphologically diverse wolf populations were out-competed and replaced by more modern wolves.[22]

        A 2016 genomic study suggests that Old World and New World wolves split around 12,500 years ago followed by the
        divergence of the lineage that led to dogs from other Old World wolves around 11,100–12,300 years ago.[19] An
        extinct Late Pleistocene wolf may have been the ancestor of the dog,[23][16] with the dog's similarity to the
        extant wolf being the result of genetic admixture between the two.[16] The dingo, Basenji, Tibetan Mastiff and
        Chinese indigenous breeds are basal members of the domestic dog clade. The divergence time for wolves in Europe,
        the Middle East, and Asia is estimated to be fairly recent at around 1,600 years ago. Among New World wolves,
        the Mexican wolf diverged around 5,400 years ago.[19]
