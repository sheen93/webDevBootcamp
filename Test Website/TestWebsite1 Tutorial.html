    <h1>Heading 1 "h1"</h1>
    <p>
        This is a paragraph, made by using "p".
    </p>

    <h2>Heading 2 "h2"-Lists</h2>
    <p>Now, this is an unordered list made using "ul" and the list items nested in the list are made using "li"</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unordered list element 1</li>
        <li>Unordered list element 2</li>
        <li>Unordered list element 3</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This is an ordered list made using "ol".
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Ordered list element</li>
        <li>Ordered list element</li>
        <li>Ordered list element</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Anchor Tags</h2>
    <p>To make anchor tags like <a href="https://www.this.com">this</a>, "a" are used to redirect to a different link or
        different
        part of the website. This anchor tag would ridirect to <a href="https://www.google.com/">google.</a></p>


    <h2>Images/Inline-Block</h2>
    <div>
        <div class="Container">
            <div class="image">
                <img src="Rick.jpg" alt="Picture of a rick">
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                This is a picture of Rick. "img" is used to place images, and the location of the iamge would go it in
                "src", and "alt" is for giving the image a name.
                Block container "div" is used to contain the text and picture together in one box. And then two
                different "div" containers, one for image and one for text. Later CSS would be used to style them side
                by side.

                Now this is a list of elements for html: <span class="html element">Span</span>, <span
                    class="html element">Div</span>, <span class="html element">Forms</span> etc. Individual "span"
                function was used to put them together in one line. Later CSS would be used to style them.
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
